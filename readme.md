## Setup

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run analyses

The two scripts `analysis.py` and `simulations.py` are responsible for actually producing the results and the plots, you can either use them in VSCode interactive mode, as the code is divided up into cells, or you can run the scripts directly in the command line.

```bash
python3 simulations.py && python3 analysis.py
```
